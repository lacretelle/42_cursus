# FILLIT

# Goals
Fillit does not consist in recoding Tetris, but remains a variant of the game in the mind.
Your program will take in parameter a file describing a list of Tetriminos
which he will then have to arrange between them to form the smallest possible square. The aim is to
of course to find this smallest square as quickly as possible in spite of a number
of layouts that grows explosively with each additional room.
It's a project group, exactly two people.
