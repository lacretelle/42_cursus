# RED TETRIS

# Goals
The pedagogical objectives are multiple, but the main axis is to introduce the language
Javascript, to discover its abundant ecosystem and to implement some of the principles,
techniques and Flagship tools of Full Stack Javascript.
Through the writing of a network Tetris game, youâ€™ll implement functional principles
(which is required), asynchronous client and server (by nature of the language) and
reagents (by nature of the game and GUI).
You will have to write unit tests that will have to be worthy of an industrial chain of
continuous delivery.
You will also discover the latest popular tools and libraries the Full Stack Javascript
like Node.js, React.js.

# Explanations:
## Available Scripts for correcting

- To do the correction you can launch :
`npm run install-server && npm start`.

- To rebuild (to be sure that build is correct) and start :
`npm run install-client && npm run install-server && npm start`

- To launch the test :
`npm run install-all && npm test`
OR (is dependencies allready installed)
npm test

### `npm run install-server`

Install server's dependencies

### `npm run install-client`

Install client's dependencies and build the app

### `npm run install-all`
Install client and server dependencies

### `npm start`

Run the server

### `npm test`

Run test in concurrently mode (need install-all before)
