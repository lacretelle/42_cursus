# Goals
In this project, you will discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular, the placement of points in space, how to connect them with segments and
especially how to observe the scene from a certain point of view.
You will also discover your first graphic library: The miniLibX.
This internally developed library gathers the minimum necessary to open a
window, turn on a pixel and manage the events linked to this window: the keyboard and the mouse.
This will be an opportunity for you to learn about "evenemential" programming.
