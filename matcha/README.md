# MATCHA

# Goals
This project proposes to create a dating website.
You will therefore have to design an application allowing a user to sign up
and fill in his personal details and preferences in the other, in order to be able to
match another user with a more or less matching profile, from among a group of
selection of profiles of other users that your site will offer.
Once they have matched each other, these two profiles should be able to exchange sweet words and more if affinities via a private chat that you will have designed.
